            <p class="paragraph">
                Welcome to the lands of Pa <span class="practical">(dont question the name)</span>, This is the entry to our small village located in the highs of this great mountain.<br>
                I see you are a traveler seeking knowledge from this place, buckle up my friend.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Ok you are ready? Great. This is a practical guide to install Pa in your machine.<br>

                I will introduce you to PBuild, It's a pre-built tool to download and build Pa!<br><br>

                But...There are prerequisites, To Build the language in your own machine you need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> Compiler!<br>
                These are the supported compilers by PBuild as of now (links):
            </p>
            <div class="table">
                <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">Gnu Compiler Collection <span style="opacity: 40%;">#</span></a><br>
                <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">Tiny C Compiler <span style="opacity: 40%;">#</span></a>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Done? PBuild is located in the <a href="https://github.com/valkarias/Pa/releases">releases</a> section of the Pa repository.<br>
                Choose the release named after your platform and download the zip.<br>

                Extract the zip and nagivate to <span class="practical">PBuild_(platform) -> pbuild -> pbuild(.exe)</span>.
                <br><br>
                
                Open up your console or terminal in the current directory (or use <span class="practical">cd</span>)<br>
                Execute the <span class="practical">download</span> command like so:<br>

                <p class="snippet">
                    pbuild download
                </p><br>
                This will download the Pa repository as a zipfile in your home directory & extracts it.<br>
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Then Execute the <span class="practical">build</span> command, it takes a required option specifying<br>
                the compiler to build with.

                <p class="snippet">
                    pbuild build --cc-type= (compiler name)
                </p><br>
                This will build the cloned repository.<br>
                <br>

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The executable file is located in <span class="practical">your-home\Pa\Pa-master\bin</span> after building is finished.
                <br><br>
                Hooray! You successfully downloaded and built Pa.
            </p>

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                To use Pa, you can either launch the executable directly or from a console/terminal.<br>
                You can execute from a file like so:

                <p class="snippet">
                    pa file.pc
                </p><br>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Lets try it.<br><br>

                Create a new file named <span class="practical">file.pc</span> and open it in your text editor of choice.
                <br>
                A classic print!

                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <pre><code class="language-js">
<span class="token builtin">print<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello reader!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                <br>
                Save it and Run it!<br>
                You should see a <span class="practical">Hello reader!</span> in your console.
            </p>

            <h3>Uninstalling Pa.</h3>

            <p class="paragraph">
                To uninstall Pa, you can run the command <span class="practical">uninstall</span> :(

                <p class="snippet">
                    pbuild uninstall
                </p><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Tooling.</h3>

            <p class="paragraph">
                As of now, there is only a syntax highlighter for the vscode text editor, avaliable in the marketplace <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pa-lang.pa-syntax-highlighter">here</a>
            </p><br>

            <p class="paragraph">
                <br>
